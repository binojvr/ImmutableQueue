# ImmutableQueue

*   Most efficient implementation of ImmutableQueue using doubly linked list (Custom)
*   Time complexity is O(1) for deQueue and enqueue operations
*   Space complexity is also excellent with O(1) 
*   Note : immutable objects says once its created it shoudld not be modified but never says we should not resuse memory. My implementation 
     reuses memeory and is immutable
